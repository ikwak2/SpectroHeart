This repository provides the overall framework for training and evaluating heart murmur detection systems proposed in 'MCHeart: Multi-Channel based Heart Signal Processing Scheme for Heart Noise Detection using Deep Learning'

## Data Access  
The training data of the George B. Moody PhysioNet Challenge 2022 can be downloaded from [PhysioNet](https://physionet.org/content/circor-heart-sound/1.0.3/) [1]. You can also download it directly using this [link](https://physionet.org/static/published-projects/circor-heart-sound/the-circor-digiscope-phonocardiogram-dataset-1.0.3.zip) or the following command:
```
wget -r -N -c -np https://physionet.org/files/circor-heart-sound/1.0.3/
```



Here's a description of the files:
